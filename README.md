## Deliverable 1: Creating DataFrames (Extract)
- This is a crucial first step to being able to really do much with the data. ETL_function_test.ipynb holds Deliverable 1, and converts the kaggle csv and ratings csv to Pandas DataFrames, as well as the Wikipedia json into a DataFrame.

## Deliverable 2: Cleaning Data (Transform)
- In this stage, the extracted wikipedia data is pared-down into meaningful, data-dense columns, and some are converted from several inconsistent forms into the necessary types for analysis with consistent formatting. The columns that have been adjusted are as follows:
  -   Budget
  -   Box Office
  -   Running Time
  -   Release Date
-   See ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb for full notebook.
